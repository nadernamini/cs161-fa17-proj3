This project was amazing. It was fun and at the same time kind of hard. I really appreciate the effort the entire course staff put into helping us on Piazza. This was by far the most intriguing assignment of the course. It actually helped me solidify my understanding of the topics introduced and discussed in the lectures and discussions.
Also, I wanted to thank Nick for designing the second midterm the way he did. I felt that I was able to convey my understanding through the questions that tested most of the topics covered in the class. I hope the trend will continue on to the final exam.
